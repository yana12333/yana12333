## Hi there 👋

My name is Yana, I am a fourth-year student.

My goal is to become an Android developer. To achieve this, I wake up at 3 a.m., do 1,000 push-ups a day, and live exclusively on lava.

I love creativity and design, which is why I want to become an Android developer. I am alsoo a big fan of music and everything related to it)

My biggest project so far is '15-Puzzle Solver', but don’t judge me too harshly — I’m still learning(((
