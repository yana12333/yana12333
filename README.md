## Hi there 👋

My name is Yana, and I am a fourth-year student.

My goal is to become a genius developer. To achieve this, I wake up at 3 a.m., do 1,000 push-ups a day, and live exclusively on lava.

I love creativity and good design. I am also a big fan of music and everything related to it.

My biggest project so far is '15-Puzzle Solver', made in Kotlin, but don’t judge me too harshly — I’m still learning
